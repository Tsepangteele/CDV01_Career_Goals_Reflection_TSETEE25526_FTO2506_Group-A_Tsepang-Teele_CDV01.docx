### Personal Information

- **Name:Tsepang Teele 
- **Date:13 July 2025
- **Current Role/Position:**
- **Field of Interest:**

### Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection

1. **Skills Analysis**:
    
    - Html is going well.
    - CSS is definately a challenge.
2. **Interests and Values**:
    
I’m deeply interested in creative tech, especially how design and code intersect. I enjoy building visually appealing, user-friendly websites and learning how small design choices can improve someone’s experience online. I’m also drawn to front-end development and UI/UX because it allows me to combine my artistic eye with logic and structure.

The values that matter to me most in a work environment are freedom, growth, and purpose. I thrive in settings where I can work remotely, manage my time independently, and feel trusted to deliver results. I value collaborative, respectful spaces that encourage creativity and learning — where people support each other and give constructive feedback. It’s also important for me to feel like my work is impactful, whether through helping others, telling stories visually, or making digital tools more accessible.

### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
    - Frond End Developer Roles such as UI/UX, Web development & App development.
    - I'm interested in all of the above.
2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
  I’m currently most interested in front-end development and UI/UX design, especially using tools land front-end languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My background in visual aesthetics (through my lifestyle brand) and my academic foundation in psychology and sociology make me naturally curious about human-centered design.

I also want to explore design systems, accessibility in interfaces, and how to blend aesthetics with usability. Understanding how code and design intersect is empowering — and being able to bring my own visions to life without depending on others is what keeps me motivated.

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
  In the short term, my goal is to strengthen my skills in front-end development and responsive design so I can confidently create functional, visually appealing websites. I plan to take on small freelance projects—such as building personal websites, portfolio pages, or basic business sites for clients—while still learning.

I’d also like to begin freelancing remotely, offering web design and development services on platforms like Upwork or Fiverr. This will allow me to earn while growing my experience, building a strong portfolio, and learning how to manage real client needs and feedback.


2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
    My long-term goal is to become a highly skilled UI/UX designer with a strong foundation in software development. I’m particularly passionate about creating digital experiences that are not only functional but also aesthetically beautiful and emotionally engaging. I’d love to contribute to apps and platforms that make people’s lives easier, more joyful, or more creative — whether through fintech tools, wellness apps, or ecommerce experiences.

Eventually, I’d like to build or co-found a product-based tech startup that merges my interests in design, psychology, and problem-solving. I also aspire to mentor young women in tech, especially in African communities, helping them feel seen and capable in this evolving space.

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
- Do more external research on the areas that I struggle with the most.
- Work with classmates on problkem solving areas of difficulty.
- Consult with my coach more and ask about areas I dont understand.

2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
- Continue with CodeSpace and fully absorb the front-end and UX-focused modules.
- Build a digital portfolio that showcases personal projects — such as revamping websites, designing app interfaces, or solving common UI problems.
 - Attend local and virtual tech events, especially ones focused on women in tech, UX communities, and product design.
- Join Discord/Slack communities for junior UX designers and developers to network, share resources, and find mentorship.

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
- Time management and juggling priorities: Balancing freelance projects, personal branding (like Venus The Brand), and ongoing coding education - might feel overwhelming at times.
- Limited industry experience: Breaking into the tech world without a traditional Computer Science background might require extra proof of skills.
- Self-doubt or imposter syndrome: Especially when entering a male-dominated space or comparing your journey to others.
2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    
- Stick to a structured weekly schedule.
- Build a strong portfolio of real-world projects and publish them via GitHub and live links.
- Join online coding communities and women-in-tech networks for support and visibility.
