These industries align with my skills due to the creative aspect that they have, I like the idea of creating something out of nothing.

    - Consulting with our coach about the parts I'm finding hard to understand.

    - Having some kind of mentor who can guide me through the industry and possibly give me tips.
    - Expanding my developer knowledge beyond html, css and javascript.
    - Potentially learning python.

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
    - Having come from a background where theory was the main focus and reading tons of information was a core element, getting used to coding sometimes feels like im learning a second language.
    - It's been taking me longer than I would like to get through the course material because trying to conceptualise whats being explained is a little difficult.
    - Practice is a big one but also looking into external resources.
    - 
2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    
    - Networking in this industry is important and having a solid portfolio can help me get into spaces that might have been difficult because I dont have a computer science degree for example.
    - Learning other coding languages after javascript would be cool
